            <h1>In addition to using your vision, it's also important to rely on your hearing to stay safe during space travel. While the vacuum of space itself is silent, you'll still need to be able to hear the sounds of your spacecraft, equipment, and communications from mission control. Make sure to wear any necessary hearing protection to prevent hearing damage, but also keep your ears alert for any unexpected or abnormal sounds that could indicate a potential problem. Remember to communicate any concerns with your team and stay vigilant at all times.</h1>
